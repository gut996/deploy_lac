                        <br>
                        <p>Tyler Pace, son of Sandy Pace and brother of Nico Pace, grew up playing his minor lacrosse in British Columbia. Tyler played Junior A for the Coquitlam Adanacs and currently plays in the NLL for the Calgary Roughnecks and the WLA for the Langley Thunder.</p> <br>
                        <p>Growing up with dreams of playing lacrosse at a top Division I University, Tyler left home in grade 10 to pursue an opportunity and eventually graduate at a boarding school in the US. Due to the lack of recruiting opportunities in BC at the time, Tyler and his family felt that this move was the best available option.</p> <br>
                        <p>Tyler was able to achieve his dream by attending the University of Denver where he would go on to become an NCAA Division I National Champion in 2015. Tyler ended his career in the top 10 of DU's program history in points and assists.</p><br>
                        <p>Upon graduating from the University of Denver in 2017, Tyler passed on an opportunity to play in the MLL (Major League Lacrosse) to come back home and build a youth lacrosse program. His goal was and still is to provide young players who have dreams of playing college lacrosse with high-level recruiting opportunities right here in BC.</p><br>
                        <p>Through his playing experiences as well as coaching youth programs all across the US, Tyler has a deep understanding of the recruiting process and a lot of "friends in high places" within the lacrosse community. </p><br>
                        <p>Tyler dedicates most of his time to lacrosse and helping aspiring student-athletes achieve their goals. Primarily keeping to himself, a typical week for Tyler includes working/coaching, training for lacrosse, golfing with friends, practising the piano, or watching sports and comedy specials.</p><br>
