                <p>At PCL, we provide innovative training sessions inspired by college and professional teams 
                   that help develop fundamental skills and overall knowledge of the game. 
                   We offerfirst-hand advice on the NCAA recruiting process and access to an 
                   ever-growing network of NCAA coaches. 
                   We attend some of the most reputable tournaments in North America to provide our players 
                   with competitive opportunities. Guiding and encouraging each player to improve upon their 
                   time-management, work ethic, and commitment to both school and lacrosse makes for a 
                   smoother transition to their future endeavours.</p>
                   <br>
                <p>In the planning process, we keep in mind and cater to the differences from one age group to the next. 
                   Our aim is to build personal relationships with each player and their families that last throughout 
                   their lacrosse journey.</p>

                <p>The goal of the Travel Program is to provide aspiring student-athletes with opportunities to earn athletic/academic scholarships. Our staff is in constant communication with Universities all across North America who are eager to recruit PCL's athletes.</p>
                <br><p>We will host 4 hours of tryouts to evaluate and select the top team made up of 17 players and 2 goalies. The team will be made up of the best available grade 10, 11 & 12 student-athletes. The tryout fee of $50 will be deducted from the total cost of the program if you make the team.</p>
                <br><p>The team selected will be put to the test preparing for a heavily recruited Ontario-based tournament in an intense six-week,12-hour program where they will learn how to become a more appealing recruit by preparing for college lacrosse on and off the field.</p>
                <br><p>Each player will receive progress reports, a letter of reference for college applications, healthy meals/snacks/supplements suggestions and a 6-week workout plan. We will also host an optional, themed Zoom meeting bi-weekly to build relationships between players and coaches, speak with special guests, learn to create highlight tapes, draft letters to college coaches, do chalk-talk, etc..</p>
                <br><p>The boys will also have the option to join in via Zoom to Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) preparation classes taught by a high-school teacher who played NCAA soccer and who understands strategies to score more successfully on the test.</p>
                <br><p>Parents will receive a breakdown of what the recruiting process looks like, scholarship expectations, information on the NCAA Clearing House, NCAA recruiting rules and information (DI, DII, DIII), and how to help their sons during what may become a hectic and emotional time. We ask that parents provide us with monthly academic progress reports from their son's councillor so that we can do a better job of helping find Universities that fit their combination of athletic and academic abilities.</p>
                <br><p>The pedigree of our coaching staff is our biggest separating factor. Team Canada, PLL, NLL, MLL, NCAA, our staff has not only done it all, but they continue to do it. With 4-6 coaches present at every session, each having extensive coaching experience in their own rights and who brings a unique skillset and approach to the game, we can provide different perspectives on what it takes to be a successful lacrosse player.</p>
                <br><p>Since the high-level recruiting events take place during the NLL season, many of our coaches are unable to attend travel events. With this in mind, two "travelling coaches" will work alongside our current pros at every session. The team will travel with those two coaches as well as two managers who will have their travel expenses covered by program fees.</p>

            <div class="program-main-text">
                <p>The goal of this Travel Program is to develop young, talented, hardworking players and prepare them for high school lacrosse both on and off the field.</p>
                <br><p>We will host 4 hours of try-outs to evaluate and select the top team made up of 16 players and 2 goalies. Try-out fee - $25.</p>
                <br><p>The team selected will be put to the test in an intense eight week, 14-hour program preparing for one of two heavily competitive tournaments which will be decided upon by the parents, players coaches and program directors. Before a decision is made, the pros and cons of both events will be laid out by the program director, Tyler Pace.</p>
                <br><p>Every player will receive monthly progress reports, healthy meals/snacks/supplements suggestions, and 8-weeks of lacrosse related "homework". "Homework" assignments will include logging hours of wall ball, workouts and time spent on schoolwork, extracurriculars, hobbies, or other sporting events, etc..</p>
                <br><p>We will also host an optional, themed Zoom meeting bi-weekly to build relationships between players and coaches, speak with special guests, do chalk-talk, etc..</p>
                <br><p>We ask that parents provide us with monthly academic progress reports from their son's councillor so that we can do a better job of helping to work with each individual based on their athletic and academic abilities.</p>                
                <br><p>The pedigree of our coaching staff is our most significant separating factor. Team Canada, PLL, NLL, MLL, NCAA, our staff has not only done it all, but they continue to do it. With 4-6 coaches present at every session, each having extensive coaching experience in their own rights and who brings a unique skillset and approach to the game, we can provide different perspectives on what it takes to be a successful lacrosse player.</p>
                <br><p>Since the high-level travel events take place during the NLL season, many of our coaches are unable to attend travel events. With this in mind, two "travelling coaches" will work alongside our current pros at every session. The team will travel with those two coaches as well as two managers who will have their travel expenses covered by program fees.</p>
                <br><p>Our annual "Pro-D Jamboree" is still in question with the status of COVID-19. If we are able to host the event, the team will participate in front of recruiters as a "warm-up" to build in-game chemistry leading up to travel event.</p>
