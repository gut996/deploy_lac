            <p>PCL played a huge role in helping our son earn a lacrosse scholarshipto play in the NCAA. PCL provides coaches who all play professional lacrosse (who have been through the recruiting process themselves), high caliber practices, travel to top recruiting events in the US & hosting their own local recruiting event. Tyler always madehimselfreadily available to answer any & all of our questions. We would highly recommendPCL to anyone who is wanting to take their lacrosse to the next level.</p>

            <p>The PCL program provides all of its players with exposure to many US college field lacrosse programs. The high-level coaching staff are we;; respected by many college 
                recruiters and helped me make contact with key people during the recruitment process. Tyler was a huge help in developing me as a player and was always available to provideguidance and support with my recruiting opportunities.</p>

            <p>The recruiting process is a daunting experience for high school athletes. Coming from the West Coast of Canada, the recruiting processwas especially difficult due to various factors includinglimited opportunities for exposure and less prominent focus on NCAA sports. I had navigated my way through the recruiting process to the best of my abilities throughout my high school career.

                In my grade 12 year, I had yet to commit to a school and time was starting to run out. In the fall of my senior year, I joined Tyler Pace's, now, Pro Caliber Lacrosse program in hopes of bringing my recruiting process to fruition. From the practices and SAT preparationcourse to the tournaments, PCL provided an unparalleledlacrosse experience for BC lacrosse players. After just our first showcase, PCL's Jamboree, I had already received interest from multiple schools as well as an offer. Interest from schools continued to come in after our main tournament, the Autumn Gold tournament. Tyler helped me with recruitment, understanding my needs and providing me with the necessary tools during this time and was able to connect me with Hofstra. I am so fortunateand thankful that I was given this opportunity as I would eventually commit to Hofstra University to play Division I lacrosse. I would like to give a huge thank you to Tyler and the rest of Pro Caliber Lacrosse for your commitment to meand my recruitment. #rollpride</p>

            <p>PCL is a program tailored to your needs as an athlete and a student. I have played on many of the best travel teams across the US and Canada, but PCL is special. Before joining PCL, I felt that I was blind in the recruiting process. I had no idea what questions to ask, how to talk about potential visits, and even how to get my name out there. PCL offers coaching from some of the best lacrosse players in the world who have gone through the recruiting process.

                Coach Pace takes a personal approach with every PCL athlete. Whether that be developing your skillset or making sure you are performing in the classroom. There was not one day while I was doing university visits that I wasn't onthe phone with Coach Pace; asking questions and gaining key advice. I am extremelythankful for the opportunity PCL provided me. I am excited about what Towson University holds for me. Go Tigers</p>

            <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank PCL and especially Tyler Pace for making our son’s goal of receiving a scholarship and attending a U.S. University come true. Our son enrolled in PCL in his final year of high school and attended a scouting tournament in Baltimore. Through PCL’s coaching and Tyler’s mentoring our son received interest from 21 University’s. Tyler and his team didn’t stop there. Their guidance and experience assisted our family in narrowing down our decision on which schools to shortlist. I will always be thankful for PCL as our son is achieving his goal and was fortunate enough to compete in NCAA final four. Without Tyler and his team's assistance this would have just been a dream and not a reality. </p>

            <p>I'd like to extend a big "Thanks!" To Tyler and all the coaches at PCL for helping my boys reach their goal of playing lacrosse at an NCAA University program. Having twin boys, the road to recruitment was both challenging and rewarding. I found that the boys' time at PCL was invaluable. The boys' read to success started with quality coaching. While practices were demanding, knowledge and positive feedback helped my guys understand what would be required at University, as they pursued a scholarship. Liam and Stuart attended University recruiting tournaments with PCL. At these tournaments, the boys were given ample time to shoe their game skills to University Coaches and recruiters.

                Positive feedback and interest were shown by DI, DII, and DIII coaches, almost immediately. What I appreciated was Tyler tempered our enthusiasm with realistic expectations. Not every player will go DI on a full-ride scholarship. There are great opportunities and programs in DII and DIII that shouldn't be overlooked. This helped us focus on the program that would be the best fit for my sons. There were also resources that helped the boys reach out to prospective Coaches with videos and letters. A big help for my boys was the opportunity to join an SAT program offered by PCL. This program helped the boys achieve good marks on their tests, helping them get the best scholarship offers available to them. When it came down to making their final decision, Tyler was a great sounding board for the boys, speaking to them personally about their options. This offered the boys an experienced opinion rather than just hearing from Mom and Dad. Ultimately, the boys ended up choosing to go to school together at Georgian Court University, a DII program in Lakewood, New Jersey. I appreciate the efforts by everyone at PCL in helping Liam and Stuart get to where they want to be. It was a worthwhile experience and I would recommend the program to any parent looking for help getting their kids through the recruiting process.</p>

            <p>Pro Caliber Lacrosse allowed me to be seen and recruited by college coaches at a level I wouldn't have been able to accomplish on my own and opened the door for me to play at the next level. The coaching staff and program not only elevated my recruiting but also improved and tailored my game to a level that would help me in college and further on into the future.

            <p>PCL is a program dedicated to helping lacrosse players like myself achieve their dreams of playing at the collegiate level. In my experience PCL was my saving grace, I had only played on one other travel team and had no idea how the recruiting process worked or if I was even good enough to play at a university. Tyler Pace and his roster of phenomenal coaches opened my eyes to a world of lacrosse much larger than I would have known, he and the rest of the PCL crew not only aided my college journey but created it by introducing me to college coaches, giving me opportunities to show my talent to coaches, and answering every question I could ever ask about the recruitment process. I will be forever thankful for the opportunities Coach Tyler and PCL have given me and thanks to them I will be continuing my lacrosse career at North Greenville University. #rollcrusaders.<p>
